#Project Description
Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 unchecked board. There are 64 identical game pieces 
called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing 
discs on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any discs of the opponent's color that are in a 
straight line and bounded by the disc just placed and another disc of the current player's color are turned over to the 
current player's color.
The object of the game is to have the majority of discs turned to display your color when the last playable empty square 
is filled.

The Scrum methodology will be followed by the development team to deliver this application. This project will be completed
by a single development team. Like other Scrum teams this team will mainly consist of a Scrum Master, Product Owner and a 
group of developers. This process model will help mitigate potential risks by providing multiple iterations of development 
and customer feedback. This process model will also provide backlogs to customer as well as management in order to assess 
progress. 

Implementation was in Java.
